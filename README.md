# polymer_databinding_demo

Wrote a simple demo to illustrate how 2-way databinding between a parent and child element works. This illustrates how properties of the child element can be changed by the parent script outside the parent. Also illustrates how to fire events from the child that propagate up to the paper.

This should be self-contained and have all the polymer elements necessary to just run.

If anyone finds this helpful, let me know what you think. I'm a novice here so comments are welcome.
